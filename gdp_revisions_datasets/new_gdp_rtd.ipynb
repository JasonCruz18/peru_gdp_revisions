    "Welcome to the **Peruvian GDP Real-Time Dataset (RTD)** construction notebook! This notebook will guide you through the **step-by-step process** of creating your own RTD using GDP revisions from the **Central Reserve Bank of Peru** (BCRP). Whether you are a researcher, policymaker, or analyst, this notebook helps you construct real-time data of monthly GDP growth for Peru, starting from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will this notebook help you achieve?\n",
    "1. **Downloading PDFs** from the BCRP Weekly Reports (WR).\n",
    "2. **Generating PDF inputs** by shortening them to focus on key pages containing GDP growth rate tables.\n",
    "3. **Cleaning-up extracted data** to ensure it's usable and building RTD.\n",
    "4. **Concatenating RTD** from different years and frequencies (monthly, quarterly, annual).\n",
    "5. **Updating metadata** for storing base years changes and other revisions-based information.\n",
    "6. **Converting RTD** to releases dataset for econometric analysis.\n",

If you wish to use a different browser, you can modify the `browser` parameter in the `init_driver()` function.\n",
