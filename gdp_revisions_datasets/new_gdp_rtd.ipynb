    "Welcome to the **Peruvian GDP Real-Time Dataset (RTD)** construction notebook! This notebook will guide you through the **step-by-step process** of creating your own RTD using GDP revisions from the **Central Reserve Bank of Peru** (BCRP). Whether you are a researcher, policymaker, or analyst, this notebook helps you construct real-time data of monthly GDP growth for Peru, starting from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will this notebook help you achieve?\n",
    "1. **Downloading PDFs** from the BCRP Weekly Reports (WR).\n",
    "2. **Generating PDF inputs** by shortening them to focus on key pages containing GDP growth rate tables.\n",
    "3. **Cleaning-up extracted data** to ensure it's usable and building RTD.\n",
    "4. **Concatenating RTD** from different years and frequencies (monthly, quarterly, annual).\n",
    "5. **Updating metadata** for storing base years changes and other revisions-based information.\n",
    "6. **Converting RTD** to releases dataset for econometric analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "🌐 **Main Data Source:** [BCRP Weekly Report](https://www.bcrp.gob.pe/publicaciones/nota-semanal.html) (📰 WR, from here on)  \n",

    "- **CAPTCHA Handling**: If a CAPTCHA appears during the download process, you'll need to manually solve it in the browser window and then **re-run the Scraper Bot**. The Scraper Bot cannot bypass CAPTCHA verification.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Automatic WebDriver Management**: This script uses `webdriver-manager` to automatically handle browser drivers (by default, it uses Chrome). **No need to manually download ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver**. If you wish to use a different browser, you can modify the `browser` parameter in the `init_driver()` function.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Custom Notification Sound**: If you'd like to receive notifications when each batch of downloads finishes, you can place your own MP3 file in the `alert_track` folder. We provide a warning track (in .mp3 format on GitHub). However, here are some free sources of .mp3 files so you can choose the ones you prefer:\n",

    "### 🚨 Main Issues in Weekly Reports and How We Cleaned Them\n",
    "\n",
    "The BCRP Weekly Reports (WRs) often present structural inconsistencies that can complicate data extraction. In this section, we focus on resolving key issues that commonly arise, ensuring the data is consistent, usable, and ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are specific problems encountered in the reports, along with the corresponding cleaning steps we implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Misaligned Headers**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem:** The header row, which typically contains sector names or year labels, was sometimes misaligned, especially when certain headers like \"SECTORES ECONÓMICOS\" were incorrectly placed.\n",
    "* **Solution:** We used the `swap_nan_se()` function to correct misalignments, ensuring the header \"SECTORES ECONÓMICOS\" is placed in the correct column.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `d = swap_nan_se(d)                       # Align 'SECTORES ECONÓMICOS' header properly`\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Mixed Header Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem:** Some columns had combined headers, such as \"Sector. Subsector,\" leading to confusion when analyzing data.\n",
    "* **Solution:** The `split_column_by_pattern()` function was used to split these combined headers into separate, meaningful columns for easier analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `d = split_column_by_pattern(d)           # Separate combined header values like \"Sector. Subsector\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Missing or Irregular Year Labels**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem:** Year labels (e.g., \"2019\", \"2020\") were either missing or misaligned across columns.\n",
    "* **Solution:** We implemented the `find_year_column()` function to automatically detect and correct year columns, ensuring consistency across the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `d = find_year_column(d)                  # Detect and align year columns automatically`\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Extra or Irrelevant Rows and Columns**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem:** Some tables contained rows or columns with redundant or irrelevant data (such as placeholders or completely missing values).\n",
    "* **Solution:** We used functions like `drop_nan_rows()`, `drop_nan_columns()`, and `drop_rare_caracter_row()` to remove these unwanted entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `d = drop_nan_rows(d)                    # Remove rows where all values are NaN`\n",

    ">\n",
    "> `d = drop_rare_caracter_row(d)           # Remove rows with rare characters like '}'`\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Mixed Numeric and Text Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem:** Some columns contained mixed content, with text and numeric values in the same column (e.g., \"Var. %\").\n",
    "* **Solution:** The `separate_text_digits()` function was used to split the mixed content into separate numeric and text values, making the data easier to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `d = separate_text_digits(d)            # Split mixed content (text + numeric) into separate columns`\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Formatting and Naming Inconsistencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem:** Sector names and labels had inconsistencies, especially between Spanish and English versions of terms like \"services\" and \"mining.\"\n",
    "* **Solution:** We standardized these terms using functions like `replace_services()` and `replace_mineria()` to harmonize the labels across all reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `d = replace_services(d)               # Standardize 'services' naming across sectors`\n",

    ">\n",
    "> `d = replace_mining(d)                 # Standardize 'mining' naming in English sectors`\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧹 Final DataFrame Cleaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "* After applying the aforementioned cleaning functions, the final DataFrame is fully normalized and ready for further analysis. We perform additional final cleaning steps to ensure the data is consistent across all columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `d = clean_columns_values(d)`         # Normalize column names and values\n",
    "> \n",
    "> `d = convert_float(d)`                # Convert non-label columns to numeric\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `d = rounding_values(d, decimals=1)`  # Round float columns to one decimal place\n",

    "In this section, we focus on **concatenating** the **Real-Time Data (RTD)** for **Table 1** (monthly GDP growth) and **Table 2** (quarterly/annual GDP growth) across multiple years. The goal is to create a unified RTD that spans all available years, aligned by **frequency** (monthly, quarterly, and annual).\n",

    "### 🛠️ What This Step Does:\n",

    "1. **Concatenates** Table 1 (monthly data) and Table 2 (quarterly/annual data) across years into unified DataFrames.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "⚙️ How the Code Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reads CSVs by Year: The functions read all the CSV files from each year folder (monthly for Table 1, quarterly/annual for Table 2).\n",
    "2. Identifies Target Period Columns: The code checks for columns that represent different time periods (e.g., tp_YYYYmM for monthly, tp_YYYYqN for quarterly).\n",
    "3. Aligns Columns Chronologically: Target period columns are sorted by year and month (for Table 1) or year and quarter (for Table 2).\n",
    "4. Vertical Concatenation: The individual DataFrames are concatenated vertically, ensuring the data from all years is combined into one unified DataFrame.\n",
    "5. Enforces Data Types: Columns are reindexed to match the final column schema, and the data types are normalized (e.g., converting numeric columns to the correct type).\n",
    "6. Optional Persistence: If the persist flag is set to True, the concatenated DataFrame is saved to disk in the specified format (CSV or Parquet).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "🧹 Cleaning and Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The process ensures that data from different years is aligned by the following steps:\n",
    "- Target period columns: All columns corresponding to time periods (e.g., months, quarters) are identified and sorted chronologically.\n",
    "- Reindexing: Each DataFrame is reindexed to match the full set of target period columns, ensuring that the columns are consistently aligned across years.\n",
    "- Handling missing data: If any data is missing for specific time periods, it is handled in the concatenation step, either by using NaN or applying a specific data imputation strategy."

    "This section is responsible for converting Real-Time GDP (RTD) datasets into releases datasets. The releases dataset is crucial for tracking and analyzing the sequence of GDP revisions. By restructuring the data into a release-based format, we can better map the evolution of GDP estimates in terms of \"releases\", helping to capture changes and dependence patterns in the statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert raw RTD data into release datasets.\n",
    "* Align non-NaN values for each industry and vintage. The first release of all target periods aligns in the first row, and so on.\n",

    "🛠️ Converting RTD to Releases Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The `convert_to_releases_dataset` function is designed to transform the RTD data into a format that is structured by release sequence. This function processes each dataset, aligning the non-NaN values for every target period and each industry, while removing any invalid values due to base-year changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Steps in Conversion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Validation:** Ensures that the input and output file lists match in length.\n",
    "2. **Sorting and Grouping:** The data is sorted by industry, year, and month, ensuring chronological order.\n",
    "3. **Aligning Non-NaN Values:** For each industry, the function aligns non-NaN values across the target periods (`tp_` columns), creating a sequence of releases.\n",
    "4. **Removing Invalid Rows:** It drops rows where all target period columns are NaN, ensuring that only valid data is retained.\n",
    "5. **Reorganization:** The dataset is pivoted, with each industry and release forming new columns.\n",
    "6. **Final Output:** The dataset is saved into a CSV file for each industry and release sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 Data Processing Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input Data: We start with the RTD data, which is stored in CSV files. Each dataset corresponds to a specific frequency (monthly, quarterly, or annual) and includes data for different vintages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sorting: Data is sorted by industry, year, and month to ensure the chronological order of releases.\n",
    "* Aligning Releases: Non-NaN values for each industry and vintage are aligned, ensuring that all releases are consistent and in the correct sequence.\n",
    "* Pivoting: The data is then pivoted to arrange each industry’s releases in separate columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Output: The converted releases datasets are saved as new CSV files, each named according to its respective label (e.g., `monthly_gdp_releases.csv`, `quarterly_annual_gdp_releases.csv`).\n",

    "---\n",

    "🔄 Key Concepts and Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Industry:** Represents the economic sector (e.g., manufacturing, agriculture) for which GDP growth rates are reported.\n",
    "* **Vintage:** Refers to the specific release of GDP data for a given period (e.g., the first release, second release, etc.).\n",
    "* **Release:** Each release refers to an updated estimate of GDP for a given target period. These releases are tracked sequentially (first, second, third, etc.) for each industry.\n",
    "* **Target Period (tp_):** These are the columns representing GDP growth rates for specific periods (e.g., \"tp_2021m01\" for January 2021)."
