    "## 📌 Summary\n",
    "Welcome to the **Peruvian GDP Real-Time Dataset (RTD)** construction notebook! This notebook will guide you through the **step-by-step process** of creating your own RTD using GDP revisions from the **Central Reserve Bank of Peru** (BCRP). Whether you are a researcher, policymaker, or analyst, this notebook helps you construct real-time data of monthly GDP growth for Peru, starting from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will this notebook help you achieve?\n",
    "1. **Downloading PDFs** from the BCRP Weekly Reports (WR).\n",
    "2. **Generating PDF inputs** by shortening them to focus on key pages containing GDP growth rate tables.\n",
    "3. **Cleaning-up extracted data** to ensure it's usable and building RTD.\n",
    "4. **Concatenating RTD** from different years and frequencies (monthly, quarterly, annual).\n",
    "5. **Updating metadata** for storing base years changes and other revisions-based information.\n",
    "6. **Converting RTD** to releases dataset for econometric analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "🌐 **Main Data Source:** [BCRP Weekly Report](https://www.bcrp.gob.pe/publicaciones/nota-semanal.html) (📰 WR, from here on)  \n",

The notebook **automatically generates the CSV files**, giving users direct access to the dataset on their own systems. The data is created on the fly and can be saved locally for further use."

If you wish to use a different browser, you can modify the `browser` parameter in the `init_driver()` function.\n",
